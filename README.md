the initial static map class is named test2. 

it used the StaticMapApi.java and StaticMapsRequest.java located in google-maps-services-java "https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-java" which is not included in this commit

test2 requests the map from the api then saves the map in a pre-created png file, (test2 saves the map in the pre-created mapone.png file)
